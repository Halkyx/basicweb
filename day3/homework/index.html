    <h1>Network Slicing</h1>
    <p>
      Network Slicing overlays multiple
      <a href="virtualnetwork.html" target="_blank">virtual network</a> on top
      of a shared network. Each slice of the network can have its own logical
      topology, security rules and performance characteristics -- within the
      limits imposed by the underlying physical networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Different slices can be dedicated to different purposes, such as ensuring
      a specific application or service gets priority access to capacity and
      delivery or isolating traffic for specific users or device classes.
      Slicing networks enables the network operator to maximize the use of
      network resources and service flexibility.
    </p>
    <div class="basic">
      <h2>The basics of network slicing</h2>
      <p>
        Slicing technologies on Ethernet networks are as old as virtual local
        area networks (<a href="vlan.html" target="_blank">VLANs</a>) The
        concept has been more fully realized with the rise of software-defined
        networking and, more recently, software-defined wide area network
        (SD-WAN), which applies SDN concepts to wide area networking. SDN
        separates the network's control plane from the packet-handling data
        plane. It enables the control plane to define virtual networks by
        defining packet-handling rules and pushing those rules out to the data
        plane devices for execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        This control of the data plane applies to both physical and virtual
        network devices managed under the SDN controller, which is a physical
        switch in a rack or a virtual switch running in a cloud environment or
        on a hypervisor in the data center.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some use cases, the network operator will want or need to dedicate
        network infrastructure to a specific slice of the network, like
        assigning a virtual firewall to a specific virtual network instead of
        using a shared firewall. In some cases, this step is done to meet
        specific customer compliance or network security requirements. In other
        cases, network managers will look to improve network performance or
        minimize the overhead of providing services. For example, network
        operators could deploy an instance of a low-cost or free firewall
        instead of paying for a more expensive one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The flip side of slicing is aggregation. An SDN approach does enable
        aggregation of physical connectivity -- the melding of multiple physical
        connections into a switch, for example -- with the resulting pooled
        capacity then made available for slicing.
      </p>

    <div class="principle">
      <h2>How does network slicing work in 5G?</h2>
      <p>
        Network slicing is a key feature of 5G, applying the same principles of
        virtualization to the radio access networks (RANs) and the supporting
        backhaul and carrier core networks that underlie 5G. Slicing enables
        service providers to make meaningful guarantees to customers regarding,
        say, a minimum amount of throughput for their connections or priority
        delivery of packets from specific types of devices or applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 5G network operator can physically segregate traffic on different
        radio networks, slice a single network, or combine the capacity of
        multiple networks and slice the pooled resources. This enables 5G
        network operators to choose the characteristics needed to support their
        target levels of spectrum efficiency, traffic capacity and connection
        density, which is how many devices can connect from a given space.

      <h2>Network slicing use cases</h2>
      <p>
        Network slicing supports use cases that focus on performance, capacity
        and security. Many use cases involve emerging internet of things (IoT)
        business models. Some network slicing use cases include the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Performance.</b>A company depending on a 5G network for
            autonomous vehicle management might contract for a mobile network
            slice with latencies under 5 milliseconds (ms) on a guaranteed
            minimum throughput per vehicle to ensure responsive control. The
            provider would provision the slice on the lowest-latency equipment
            and paths between vehicles and cloud or edge resources and reserve
            enough capacity to meet the throughput target.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Capacity.</b>For a security monitoring system in a large
            auditorium, latency may not matter. But the security company may
            want to buy guaranteed delivery of the camera data. In other words,
            the company would want its traffic to get 1.5 megabits per second
            (Mbps) of throughput per camera with no packets dropped, ever. The
            provider might aggregate multiple connectivity and processing device
            options to meet the needs of this slice.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Security</b>For a human health monitoring system in a
            metropolitan area, a hospital might want to isolate all traffic to
            and from pacemakers. This would minimize the risk of a leak of
            customer data and the threat of compromise of the control channel --
            so it would require a slice with single-user devices.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

      <h2>Business and enterprise possibilities</h2>
      <p>
        Enterprises and smaller businesses find slicing an attractive option on
        their own networks, for both performance and security management, hence
        the rapid rise of SD-WAN and network segmentation technologies. As 5G
        networks continue to mature and spread, slicing increases the utility of
        a wireless WAN (WWAN) and an enterprise wireless LAN (WLAN).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>WWAN.</b>Before 5G, small branch offices have depended on 4G
            Long-Term Evolution (LTE) as backup connectivity in case their
            primary wired connections fail and, less often, used it as primary
            connectivity. 5G, with higher speeds and slicing, will accelerate
            the adoption of the WWAN model and increase use as primary or sole
            connectivity, since companies will get meaningful service-level
            agreements (SLAs) that reflect the carriers' ability to control
            capacities and performance.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>WLAN.</b>Those same capabilities for greater control will
            increase the appeal of 5G as a replacement for private Wi-Fi-based
            WLANs. Traditionally, enterprises provision and manage a private
            network and implement remote and mobile network access technologies.
            With 5G and slicing, many will instead use 5G only. Users have the
            same experience independent of location thanks to mobile broadband
            service via a private network slice integrated to the company WAN.
